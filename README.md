# Determing whether a supplier is strategic
  The purpose of this repo is to document my learning by working on small projects. 
### 1) Determining strategic supplier project:
##### Project intro:
  This project was about trying to use statistical models to determine whether a supplier was strategic. The data was collected on a capital equipment's purchasing department. The input data include data from five areas : supplier's financial rating, past due delivery counts and the amount of past due delivery, new business awarded to the supplier(a way to measure competitiveness), supplier quality metrics and trust score with the supplier. Data was collected over 38 suppliers.Some of the data were available in the company's system while other data like trust rating was derived over surveys.
#### Variables:
The following is a detailed list of derived data and original data used in building the statistical modeling.
  - financial score: variable name is 'credit_score'.There is a credit score generated by a financial tool with basic financial information provided by a suppllier.This is a mandatory piece of information for awarding new business. Because over 30% of the suppliers are missing this info. This variable has been transformed into a factors with 0 representing missing data and 1 representing having valid financial score.
  - delivery info: there is info on each supplier about past due quanty per week and past due part number( the type of parts past due) per week on the same 52 week interval. Because the data was fairly normaly distributed, the average of the two metrics were taken to use as variables and their names are mean_ps_qty_norm and mean_ps_pn_norm. 'norm' just means normalized. All the data were normalized since they are on very different scales.
  - competitive info: Information given on this was a new business awarded to the supplier at a part level in the three years. This information is taken as a total level via a variable called 'total_added_turnover_n'.
  - quality info: Variable 'quality score' was used to represent the quality info.'PIQ'and "PPM NC' are two metrics in the quality measurement and were included as a variable for determing whether the supplier was strategic. This information was directly available from a quality system.
  - trust rating: trust info is collected via a survey that measures the trust on four different areas :competence, integrity, dependability, and reliability. Average of the scores on the questions was used as a variable in the tidy data and the name of the variable is 'avg_trust_rating'.
  - other variables related to each supplier include: 1) 'turnover' represents the turnover for the supplier in terms of dollar amount;  2) 'turnover_ratio' represents the turnover ratio of the supplier in relation to the dollar amount of the business in this type of parts that the case company sources.
